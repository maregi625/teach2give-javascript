## Data Types
-Javascript has six primitive data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and bigInt.

1) # Boolean
- It is a logical data type that can only be true or false.

Example

```javascript
let isboy = true;
let isgirl = false;

```
2) # Null
- null simply means empty on purpose.

Example

```javascript
let name = null; // No name yet

```
3) # Undefined
- Refers to a variable that has been declared but has not initialized.

Example

```javascript
let people;
console.log(people); // Output: undefined
```
4) # Number
-It is a numeric data type.It stores both intergers and decimals.

Example

```javascript
let population = 90; // Integer
let total = 70.42; // Decimal
let notANumber = NaN; // Not a Number (invalid math operation)
```

5) # String
- It is a sequence of characters.
-They are enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Example

```javascript
let firstName = "Jack";
let lastName = 'Naven';
let fullName = "Jack Naven";
let quote = 'I\'m learning CSS';
```
6) # BigInt
- It is a data type that is used to represent integers that are too large to be represented by a standard JavaScript number type.

Example

```javascript
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // "n" at the end makes it a BigInt
console.log(bigNumber);
```
Pont to note

- Data types are used to determine the type of data stored in a variable.
- Data types are used to determine the behavior of a variable.
