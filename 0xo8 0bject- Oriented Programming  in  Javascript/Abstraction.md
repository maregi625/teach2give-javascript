## Abstraction
-Abstraction is about hiding implementation details and exposing only the relevant parts to the user.

-This helps in reducing complexity by providing a clean and simple interface.

-Unlike encapsulation, which focuses on restricting access to data, abstraction is about making interactions with objects simpler while keeping the internal logic hidden.

For example, When you drive a car, you donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally. You just use the `accelerate()`, `brake()`, and `refuel()` functions without worrying about the underlying mechanics.

Example

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0;

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${this.#balance}`);
  }

  checkBalance() {
    console.log(`Current balance is: ${this.#balance}`);
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount > this.#balance) {
      console.log(`Please enter an amount that matches your balance`);
    } else {
      this.#balance -= amount;
      console.log(
        `Successful withdrawal of ${amount}. New balance: ${this.#balance}`,
      );
    }
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("John");
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(900); // Please enter an amount that matches your balance
account.withdraw(200); // Successful withdrawal of 200. New balance: 300
```
