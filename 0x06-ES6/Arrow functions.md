## Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions are a new way to write functions in JavaScript.

- They are shorter and more concise than regular functions.

Example

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(10, 5)); // 15
```

- Arrow functions are often used in combination with other features in JavaScript, such as destructuring and the spread operator.
